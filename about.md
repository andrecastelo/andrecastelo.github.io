I've been programming since I was 12, writing terrible IRC scripts and Delphi applications, and since then I've dabbled in more structured languages. I work as a software developer at [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com), an exclusive network of the top freelance software developers, designers, and finance experts in the world.

I'm very passionate about technology and I love learning new frameworks, languages, libraries, and break them apart and see what's inside. When coding I specialize in Laravel and PHP, a strong dose of Javascript (and Webpack, Gulp, all that jazz), but I dabble a bit in Python and Ruby. I used to love Angular but we broke up.
