I've been programming since I was 12, writing terrible IRC scripts and Delphi applications. Since then I've dabbled in more structured languages and now I work as a technical director at [Estrategia](http://www.estrategiamktdigital.com), a software shop for Android, iOS and Web applications. I'm passionate about technology and love to learn new ways to build products, and luckily I have a certain amount of freedom to pursue those goals.

When coding I specialize in Laravel and PHP, responsive design, Javascript and Sass/CSS, but I'm trying to include more Ruby and more Python in there. I also love Angular, and it's my tool of choice when developing sites on top of an API.
